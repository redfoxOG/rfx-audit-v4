# Repository Guidelines

- **Do not modify application code** without running `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to verify the project still compiles.
- Documentation updates (including this file and the README) are always welcome.
- Use Node.js 20 as specified in `.nvmrc`.
- Install dependencies with `npm install` before running any commands.
