# RFx Audit Core

RFx Audit Core is a web interface for running security assessments on domains, IP addresses, and URLs. It was originally generated with Hostinger's Horizon AI Webapp Builder and communicates with Supabase functions for authentication and scanning orchestration. A self-hosted Docker deployment is recommended for local use.

## Features

- **Target Management** – add, edit, and remove domains or IPs.
- **Scanning Engine** – trigger basic checks (header and DNS) or advanced scans (port, vulnerability, SSL, full reconnaissance). Premium plans unlock advanced scans and higher limits.
- **Real-time Logs** – view a live log stream while scans are running.
- **Audit Reports** – review past assessments with collapsible sections and links to third-party tools.
- **User Accounts** – authentication and profile management powered by Supabase.
- **Billing & Plans** – Stripe integration for premium subscriptions.
- **Settings** – configure API keys, notifications, n8n automation hooks and more.

public/         Static assets served by Vite
plugins/        Visual editor utilities generated by Horizon
vite.config.js  Vite configuration
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- npm 9+
- Access to a Supabase project for backend functions

JavaScript dependencies are listed in `package.json`.

## Development

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run dev          # start local development server
npm run build        # build production assets
npm run preview      # serve built assets for testing
```

## Docker

This repository now includes a Dockerfile and compose file for easy deployment. The image builds the production assets using Node 20 and serves the `dist/` directory with `serve`.

### Local usage

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The container listens on port `4173` (mapped to `8080` by default in `docker-compose.yml`). Portainer can deploy the stack directly from this repository using the compose file.
