# RFx Audit Core

RFx Audit Core is a web interface for running security assessments on domains, IP addresses, and URLs. It was originally generated with Hostinger's Horizon AI Webapp Builder and communicates with Supabase functions for authentication and scanning orchestration. A self-hosted Docker deployment is recommended for local use.

## Features

- **Target Management** – add, edit, and remove domains or IPs.
- **Scanning Engine** – trigger basic checks (header and DNS) or advanced scans (port, vulnerability, SSL, full reconnaissance). Premium plans unlock advanced scans and higher limits.
- **Real-time Logs** – view a live log stream while scans are running.
- **Audit Reports** – review past assessments with collapsible sections and links to third-party tools.
- **User Accounts** – authentication and profile management powered by Supabase.
- **Billing & Plans** – Stripe integration for premium subscriptions.
- **Settings** – configure API keys, notifications, n8n automation hooks and more.
